The objective was to create the most convenient platform to hire people consequently increasing employment in vulnerable groups. We realized how fragmented the local services industry in the country really was and how difficult it could be for some people to get hired. Even, it was incredibly difficult to find the right professional for anything- whether one needed to find a housemaid or a home tutor. So we decided to solve this problem by leveraging technology.  Through this technology we foresee that every business will have access to every worker and it will be only separated by search. The middle operators that have historically defined how the workforce is accessed will go away.
